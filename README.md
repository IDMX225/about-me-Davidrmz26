Skills learned in each section while working on my final project.

* First, we learned how to create html and the basics of working and typing in VS Code.

* We learned how to add images to our website and the rules that must be followed while coding.

* We set up the project in Github and Netlify, learing how to name our websites.

* We learned the basics of adding color and text designs to our site.

* We learned how to do CPR in VS Code, and how to summon & use the developers tool of our website.

* We learned about responsive designs, how to adjust heights and widths considering various devices.

* How to incorporate embedded media to our website, in this case, a interactive video.

* Web forms, receiving data from people who visits our site.

* A navigation bar

* Using contrasting color pallette
Background turquoise #3CA69B
Brown for text, footer, and navbar #3C322E
Strong orange to contrast with the brown #E64A01
Lighter turquoise to invert with the background #19E6D1

* Creating a logo
To create my own at fifma.com , I went beyond just using the initials for my first and last name. I wanted to include all of 
my four initials for first, middle, and both of my last names. I made my first name initial bigger, then a lowercase e 
for the middle, and my two last name initials R and M connecting with each other. 
I chose the colors to blend in with my navigation color palette, the letters are distributed with ones having an orange fill 
and brown outline, and the other having brown fill and orange outline, you can observe it in my website if you point at my 
logo thanks to an special effect to invert the background color.

* How to do a hamburger icon menu
My hamburger icon menu was inspired by the tutorial from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIzi9z8mrTk done by Angela Design. 
To create the close and menu elements shapes I used the code given by her at: https://codepen.io/angeladelise/pen/poErPMY

* Blog
My blog topic consited of investigating image hover effects.
My first effect was to blur an image, I researched from the website Brandsmen Marketing Agency at 
https://thebrandsmen.com/css-image-hover-effects/ . There were some interesting tutorials there, I chose the blur
effect since it was the one I found most interesting.

My second effect was to do a shake animation for an image, I researched from the website w3schools at:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_shake_image.asp . There were lot of interesting tutorials to see there
while I was clicking through next and previous, I chose animation since is something that I want to investigate further 
in the future.

My third effect was change the visual shape of an image, to get rid of the borders, in this case my image was a square
and I turned it into a circle. I researched from the website Foo Plugins at: https://fooplugins.com/thumbnail-hover-effect/ .

LICENSES (I wish to put license that my images and logo will not be using for other than just for the purpose of sharing my website).
