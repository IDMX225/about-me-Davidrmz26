            <h2>Biography:</h2>
            
            <div>

                <p>
                    My full name is David Esteban Ramirez Mazariego, and I'm originally from El Salvador.
                    I came to live to the United States when I was 13 years old. Since then, I have embraced the 
                    opportunities and experiences available to me here, striving to achieve my goals and make a positive 
                    impact. Currently, I am a computer science student at Raritan Valley Community College, where I am 
                    in my sophomore year, diligently working toward my dreams. On this fall 2024 I took this web development 
                    class to extend my skills of working with more coding languages, and getting out of my confort zone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My primary academic goal is to earn an Associate's degree at RVCC and then transfer to a university to 
                    complete my Bachelors degree. My ultimate aspiration is to pursue a Master's degree specializing in
                    Artificial Intelligence, a field that fascinates me because of its potential to revolutionize 
                    industries and solve complex global challenges. I aim to use my skills and knowledge to contribute 
                    to technological advancements that benefit society and improve lives worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I have a variety of hobbies that help me relax and recharge. I enjoy watching and 
                    playing soccer, which has always been a passion of mine. I also like working out to stay healthy and playing
                    video games for entertainment. For outdoor activities, I often visit zoos and aquariums, where 
                    I love observing animals and learning about them. Additionally, I am an avid viewer of documentaries 
                    about history, different cultures, wildlife, and the environment. 
                    During vacations I also like to dive into concepts of my study field to take advantage of the free time.

            <h2>Image Hover Effect</h2>

            <section id="blur">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        This is the research section of my project. I went to different websites to understand the process 
                        behind images hover effects. In my README there's the citations of all the sites. In my opinion, the hover 
                        effects are one of the better aspects if not the best to get more in depth with. The various choices 
                        available are practically infinite, if you are creative you can spend lots of hours adding more style to 
                        your content.
                        The first hover effect consist of blurring the image, using a filter, you select the option blur,
                        you are able to select how long does it take and what level of pixels you want to blur the image. 
                        For this hover effect, I did my research at the website Brandsmen Marketing Agency, which provides 
                        guide of how to make websites more appealing by including effects on images that drives the attention of 
                        our eyes. Changing the image quality has to be one of the most unique features available to CSS code, 
                        the code is not that difficult for writing it in a code editor, however, I imagine that the process behind 
                        it has to be more complex. Changing its quality it's just one of the many features that can affect an image,  
                        there are also various guides to change its color, adding various filters to make the image look better.
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="img/drawing.jpg" alt="Blur image">  
                    
                    <p>
                        CSS Code:<br>
                        #blur div img:hover{<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: blur(7px);<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transition: 7s ease;<br>
                        }
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            
            <section id="shake">
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The second hover effect consists of an animation, in this case shaking. The way is works is 
                        by selecting how long you want the animation to last, then using keyframes, you select the different 
                        positions and displacements that the image will move to. For a shake animation to work, the image 
                        will have to have a minimal movement, then you select how many times does the animation repeat. In this 
                        code, the infinite option is selected, making the image continue shaking while the user is pointing at it.
                        This concept was explored at the website w3schools which offers educational guides like guides for 
                        creating and editing websites. There were various guides there, I have always been interested in animation, 
                        investigating of the basics aspects of it was worth it to understand more about it. While the code for this 
                        one was the largest, I would say is the simplest since the code behind it focuses on changing the image 
                        position and degree of displacement, which is a basic for online animation. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="img/drawing.jpg" alt="Shake image"> 
                    <p>
                        CSS Code:<br>
                        #shake div img:hover {<br>

                        }<br>
                          
                          @keyframes shake {<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% { transform: translate(-3px, 0px) rotate(3deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30% { transform: translate(3px, 2px) rotate(0deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40% { transform: translate(1px, -1px) rotate(3deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50% { transform: translate(-1px, 2px) rotate(-4deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60% { transform: translate(-3px, 1px) rotate(0deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70% { transform: translate(3px, 1px) rotate(-4deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80% { transform: translate(-1px, -1px) rotate(3deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90% { transform: translate(1px, 2px) rotate(0deg); }<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100% { transform: translate(2px, -3px) rotate(-4deg); }<br>
                          }
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The third hover effect is simpler. In this case it will make an illusion of turning the image into a 
                        a circular like form. This is done changing the transition of the image's border as well as its radius.  
                        I found the guide for accomplishing this is the website Foo Plugins, the website contains around 20 
                        different hover effects. I found this one to be interesting and I wanted one that was different for the 
                        previous hover effects, since they were more about changing the image values, or the position, this one 
                        focuses more on changing the image's shape. I think this is an aspect that could be explore more in detail, 
                        for example, changing it to a difficult shape such as star, or in this image's case, a shark's shape could be  
                        interesting to attempt.               
                    </p>
