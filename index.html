            <h2>An Excerpt From Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p>"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely; that big child-brain of 
                    his is working. Well for us, it is, as yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain 
                    things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries 
                    before him can afford to wait and to go slow. Festina lente may well be his motto."</p>

                <p>"I fail to understand," said Harker wearily. "Oh, do be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are 
                    dulling my brain."</p>

                <p>The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--</p>

                <p>"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge 
                    experimentally. How he has been making use of the zo√∂phagous patient to effect his entry into friend 
                    John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first 
                    make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not 
                    see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must be so. 
                    But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not 
                    himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he found that this be all-right, he try to move them 
                    all alone. And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are hidden. 
                    He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as 
                    he can change his form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his hiding-place! But, my child, 
                    do not despair; this knowledge come to him just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for
                     him; and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he can move and hide. I delayed this 
                     morning that so we might be sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even more 
                     careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on 
                     their way to us. To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are five of 
                     us when those absent ones return."</p>

                <p>Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postman's knock of the 
                    telegraph boy. We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to 
                    keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a despatch. The Professor closed the door 
                    again, and, after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud.</p>

                <p>"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. 
                    He seems to be going the round and may want to see you: Mina."</p>

                <p>There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--</p>

                <p>"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!" Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said:--</p>
